# Multiprogramming Operating System Simulation

## Overview

This Java project simulates a simple operating system environment with multiprogramming capabilities using a virtual machine model. It provides functionalities for process management, memory management, and I/O operations.

## Components

1. **PCB Class:**
    - Represents process attributes.
    - Provides methods to initialize and display process details.

2. **VirtualMachine Class:**
    - Simulates the virtual machine with memory, registers, and control logic.
    - Handles system calls and performs I/O operations.

3. **UserMode Class:**
    - Manages user-level operations, including loading programs, executing processes, and memory allocation.

## Usage

1. **Import the Project:**
    - Import the Java project into your preferred IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

2. **Run the Simulation:**
    - Execute the `Main` class to start the simulation.
    - Ensure input files (`input.txt`) are provided for program execution.
    - The output will be generated accordingly and saved in `output.txt`.

## File Structure

- `Main.java`: Entry point of the program.
- `PCB.java`: Process Control Block class.
- `VirtualMachine.java`: Virtual machine simulation class.
- `UserMode.java`: User mode operations class.
- `input.txt`: Input file containing programs to be executed.
- `output.txt`: Output file containing execution logs.
